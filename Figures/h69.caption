Relationship of the residue at 21987 in Delta lineage samples (representing Spike 142) with the residue at 21767 representing Spike 69/70del. Most of the small number of 'revertants' with G at position 21987 also have a gap at 21767, corresponding to the Spike 79/70 deletion found in B.1.1.7. This suggests that these sequences represent contamination from B.1.1.7 (either as a mixed infection or in the laboratory) that is specific to amplicon 72 because of the reduced efficiency of this amplicon in Delta samples.
